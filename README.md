# Leetcode Notes


This repo contains notes and examples of topic you'll run into solving problems at leetcode. What you won't find is
anwsers to individual problems in this repo unless it adds to the topic add hand or evaluates skills. The goal is to understand why leetcode has these problems and what the 
solution can be used to solved outside of leetcode.

You might have noticed on your adveture though solving leetcode problems are patterns that lead to the most optimum
result. Here is a list a some of these patterns or what I like to can them strategies. I prefer not to call them "patterns" because they be confused with "Design Patterns" which are a completly different can of worms. 

1. Prefix Sums
2. Two Pointer
3. Sliding Window
4. Fast + Slow Pointers
5. Link List in place Reversal
6. Monotonic Stack
7. Top 'k' Element
8. Quick Select
9. Overlapping Select
10. Modified Binary Search
11. Depth First Search
12. Breath First Search
13. Matrix Traversal
14. Back Tracking
15. Dynamic Programming

View this video from youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYZk8nrXVY&t=81s for an explanation of these strategies

This isn't a complete list of these stategies there are most likely more of them. The other goal is to find applications for 
these strategies which will help with identifing what strategy to use for example. 

## Prefix Sums Applications

1. Range Sum Queries
2. Dynamic Programming (Interesting!)
3. Subarray Problems
4. Sliding Window Techniques (Interesting!)
5. Counting Subarrays with Specific Properties
6. 2D Prefix Sums (for 2D Arrays)
7. Time Series Analysis
8. Real-Time Data Processing
9. String Matching and Algorithmic Problems
10. Space Efficiency in Algorithms
11. Optimization Problems
12. Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning

This list comes from grok AI and is defently not a complete list. There are probably other applications out there for these strategies.
The ones that are marked (Interesting!) show that Prefix Sum tie back into both "Dynamic Programming" and "Sliding Window"

The notes in the notes directory are from interet searchs, grok, and my own person nots. They also contain links to example that are appart of the src folder.
